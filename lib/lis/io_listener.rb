  # a chainable IO-Listener that provides two methods:
  #
  # {#on_data} ::
  #   a callback that is called whenever a message is received
  # {#write} ::
  #   can be called so send messages to the underlying IO
  #
  # when overriding this class, you need to implement two methods:
  #
  # {#receive} ::
  #   is called from an underlying IO whenever a message is received
  #   the message can be handled.  Call {#forward} to propagate
  #
  # {#write} ::
  #   transform/encode a message before sending it. Call +super+ to propagate
  #
  # See {LineBasedProtocol} for a toy implementation which strips
  # newlines and only forwards complete lines.
